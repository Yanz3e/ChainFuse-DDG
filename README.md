# ChainFuse-DDG
ChainFuse-DDG is a chain-aware ΔΔG toolkit for antibody single-point mutations. It builds ESM-1b feature deltas, trains a low-rank Siamese energy model with OOF validation, fits an optional isotonic calibrator, and scans all mutants with ranked tables and volcano plots. GPU-ready and reproducible.
